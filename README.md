Sentiment analysis, sometimes also called opinion mining, is a popular sub discipline of the broader field of NLP; it is concerned with analysing the polarity of documents.

A popular task in sentiment analysis is the classification of text based on the expressed opinions or emotions of the end-user about a particular topic.

We have built a Sentiment Analysis model on a large dataset of reviews from IMDb and then deployed this model over the localhost.
